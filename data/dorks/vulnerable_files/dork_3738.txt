Description:      allinurl:forcedownload.php?file=


Didn't see this anywhere in the GHDB, but its been known for a while and 
 
 widely abused by others.
 
 
 
 Google Dork "allinurl:forcedownload.php?file="
 
 
 
 Sites that use the forcedownload.php script are vulnerable to url 
 
 manipulation, and will spit out any file on the local site, including the 
 
 PHP files themselves with all server side code, not the rendered page, but 
 
 the source itself. This is most commonly used on wordpress sites to grab the 
 
 wp-config.php file to gain access to the database, but is not limited to 
 
 wordpress sites. I only list it as an example, so people understand the 
 
 weight of flaw.
