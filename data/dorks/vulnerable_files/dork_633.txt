Description:      "powered by YellDL"

Finds websites using YellDL (or also known as YellDownLoad), a download tracker written in PHP. Unfortunately this downloader downloads everything you want to, like its own files too:http://xxxxxxxxxx/download.php?f=../download&e=phpBy guessing some could download information which shoudln't get out of the server (think of ../phpMyAdmin/config.php or other stuff - no need to say that lazy people use same passwords for their DB- and FTP-login.Another search to find this software is:"You are downloading *" "you are downloader number * of this file"
