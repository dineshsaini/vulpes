Description:      filetype:cgi inurl:cachemgr.cgi


cachemgr.cgi is a management interface for the Squid proxy service. It was installed by default in /cgi-bin by RedHat Linux 5.2 and 6.0 installed with Squid. This script prompts for a host and port which it then attempts to connect to. If a web server, such as apache, is running this can be used to connect to arbitrary hosts and ports, allowing for potential use as an intermediary in denial of service attacks, proxied port scans, etc. Interpreting the output of the script can allow the attacker to determine whether or not a connection was established.
