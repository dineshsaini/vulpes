GoogleDork:       Gallery configuration setup files
Description:      Gallery configuration setup files


Gallery is a popular images package for websites. Unfortunately, with so many users, more bugs will be found and Google will find more installations. This search finds Gallery sites that seem to have left more or less dangerous files on their servers, like resetadmin.php and others.We call it Gallery in Setup mode :)
