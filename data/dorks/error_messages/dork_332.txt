Description:      "Internal Server Error" "server at"


We have a similar search already, but it relies on "500 Internal Server" which doesn't appear on all errors like this one. It reveals the server administrator's email address, as well as a nice server banner for Apache servers. As a bonus, the webmaster may have posted this error on a forum which may reveal (parts of) the source code.
