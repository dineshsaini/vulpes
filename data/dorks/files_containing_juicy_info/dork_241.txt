Description:      inurl:php.ini filetype:ini


The php.ini file contains all the configuration for how PHP is parsed on a server. It can contain default database usernames, passwords, hostnames, IP addresses, ports, initialization of global variables and other information. Since it is found by default in /etc, you might be able to find a lot more unrelated information in the same directory.
