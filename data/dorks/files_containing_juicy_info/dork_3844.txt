Description:      filetype:ini "This is the default settings file for new PHP installations"


Finds PHP configuration files (php.ini) that have been placed in indexed folders. Php.ini defines a PHP installation's behavior, including magic quotes, register globals, and remote file operations. This can be useful for knowing which attacks (such as RFI) are possible against the server. - Andy G - twitter.com/vxhex
