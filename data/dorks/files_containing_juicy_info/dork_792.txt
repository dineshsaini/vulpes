Description:      filetype:cnf inurl:_vti_pvt access.cnf


The access.cnf file is a "weconfigfile" (webconfig file) used by Frontpage Extentions for Unix. The install script called change_server.sh processes them. These files leak information about the realm name and the full path on the server for it.
