Forget Bluetooth Hacking! You'll be amazed, at how many people sync their Cell Phones to the same Computers they run some type of Server on. This Query literally gives you access to peoples private contact lists that are ether on there Smart Phones', or on their Windows CE wireless devices.An attacker could Spoof Emails with the "SIG" details of the persons Phone firmware, or simply collect the cellular numbers for something later on down the road.I even hypotheticlly came across some private text messages!
