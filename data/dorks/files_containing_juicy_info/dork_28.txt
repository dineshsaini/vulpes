this brings up sites with phpinfo(). There is SO much cool stuff in here that you just have to check one out for yourself! I mean full blown system versioning, SSL version, sendmail version and path, ftp, LDAP, SQL info, Apache mods, Apache env vars, *sigh* the list goes on and on! Thanks "joe!" =)
