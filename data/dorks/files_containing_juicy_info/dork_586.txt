With Compulive News you can enter the details of your news items onto a webform and upload images through your browser. It integrates seamlessly within your website.When you open your CNU5 zip there is a news folder created with three subfolders: htmlarea, images and admin. In the news folder is your database file ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“news.mdbÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢.For security purposes the manual recommends that you immediately rename this database to a name of your own choosing thereby making it harder for anyone to download your news database.The database contains the plain text password. PS: this search is based on the index.of method. There are other ways to find this software, but finding the news database becomes a lot more difficult for an attacker that way.
