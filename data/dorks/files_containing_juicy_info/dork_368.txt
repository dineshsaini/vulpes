Description:      intitle:"index of" +myd size


The MySQL data directory uses subdirectories for each database and common files for table storage. These files have extensions like: .myd, .myi or .frm. An attacker can copy these files to his machine and using a tool like 'strings' possibly view the contents of the database.
