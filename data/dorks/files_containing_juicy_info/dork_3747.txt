Description:      inurl:"trace.axd" ext:axd "Application Trace"


example google dork to find trace.axd, a file used for debugging asp that reveals full http request details like cookie and other data that in many cases can be used to hijack user-sessions, display plain-text usernames/passwords and also serverinfo like pathnames second with plain-text usernames and passwords along with sessiondata. this file should be developer-only and not publicly available but seems to be used quite often, usually hidden from google with robots.txt.
