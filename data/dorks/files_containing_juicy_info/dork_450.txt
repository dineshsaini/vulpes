GoogleDork:       Quicken data files
Description:      Quicken data files


The QDATA.QDF file (found sometimes in zipped "QDATA" archives online, sometimes not) contains financial data, including banking accounts, credit card numbers, etc. This search has only a couple hits so far, but this should be popular in the coming year as Quicken 2005 makes it very easy and suggests to backup your data online.
