Description:      ext:pem "PRIVATE KEY" -site:facebook.com -example -test*


Locate private keys that are publicly accessible.
 
 You can also look use filetype:pem to search instead.
 
 Other file types that may represent keys include:
 .p12
 .pki
 .crt
 .key
 
 Looking for the term "PRIVATE KEY" will look for the typical "BEGIN RSA
 PRIVATE KEY" or "END RSA PRIVATE KEY" but will target multiple key types
 and both beginning and end.
 
 Removing site's like facebook.com reduces the number of user names that may
 match the search. Removing words like "example" and "test" removes the
 number of keys that are published on purpose for demonstrations.
 
 This will produce a LOT of github results. If you want to look for other
 sites that may have accidentally published keys, add "-site:github.com" or
 "-github"
 
 Happy hunting.
