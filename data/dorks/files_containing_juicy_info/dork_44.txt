GoogleDork:       haccess.ctl (VERY reliable)
Description:      haccess.ctl (VERY reliable)


haccess.ctl is the frontpage(?) equivalent of the .htaccess file. Either way, this file decribes who can access a web page, and should not be shown to web surfers. Way to go, googledork. =PThis method is very reliable due to the use of this google query:filetype:ctl BasicThis pulls out the file by name then searches for a string inside of it (Basic) which appears in the standard template for this file.
