The UBB trial version contains files that are not safe to keep online after going live. The install files clearly state so:CAUTIONS Do not leave pathto.asp or ubb6_test.cgi on your server. Delete them from the server when you are done. Leaving them in place poses a security risk."This searches pathto.asp files and allows an attacker to know the exact installed path of the software.Examples:The path to your Site is -- g:\0E5\goldenstateeng.xxx\webThe path to your Site is -- D:\inetpub\wwwroot\01xx738\mc10s9izz
