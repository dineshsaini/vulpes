Description:      intitle:"index of" pagefile.sys


This large (normally over 1GB) file is created by Windows Systems when
 there is not enough RAM in the system. Since lots of the RAM is in the
 file, chances are that a lot of good information will be in it.
 
 This is a Windows dork, wont work in Linux or Mac.
