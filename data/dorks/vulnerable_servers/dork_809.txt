I was playing around on the net when I found a small problem with Novell's WebAcces. With User.lang you can give in you're language as parameter I tried some different stuff there and when I tried so that the URL would be hxxp://www.notsohappyserver.com/servlet/webacc?User.Lang="&gt; this link appeared I clicked it and so I found unprotected dirs.In hxxp://www.notsohappyserver.com/com/novell/webaccess/ is a file called WebAccessUninstall.ini and this file contains info like servernames installationpaths and servers context
