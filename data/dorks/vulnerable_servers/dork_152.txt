Description:      allinurl:install/install.php


Pages with install/install.php files may be in the process of installing a new service or program. These servers may be insecure due to insecure default settings. In some cases, these servers may allow for a new installation of a program or service with insecure settings. In other cases, snapshot data about an install process can be gleaned from cached page images.
