# Google Dork: inurl:/proc/self/cwd
 
 
 
 Vulnerable web servers that have either been misconfigured or compromised in 
 
 some manner already, allow appending "/proc/self/cwd/" with the path of 
 
 local server files. This could be from an LFI on an insecure PHP script like 
 
 file=/proc/self/cwd/some/path/to/file, or directly in the URL path of the 
 
 site like somesite.com/proc/self/cwd/some/exposed/stuff/here
