Description:      "Welcome to Intranet"


According to whatis.com: "An intranet is a private network that is contained within an enterprise. [...] The main purpose of an intranet is to share company information and computing resources among employees [...] and in general looks like a private version of the Internet." Intranets, by definition should not be available to the Internet's unwashed masses as they may contain private corporate information.
