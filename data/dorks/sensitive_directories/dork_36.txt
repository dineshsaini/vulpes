The \WINNT directory is the directory that Windows NT is installed into by default. Now just because google can find them, this doesn't necessarily mean that these are Windows NT directories that made their way onto the web. However, sometimes this happens. Other times, they aren't Windows NT directories, but backup directories for Windows NT data. Wither way, worthy of a nomination.
