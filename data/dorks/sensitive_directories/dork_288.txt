Description:      filetype:cfg ks intext:rootpw -sample -test -howto


Anaconda is a linux configuration tool like yast on suse linux. The root password is often encrypted - like md5 or read from the shadow. Sometimes an attacker can also get a cleartext password.There are more ks configs then you might expect and with a bit of searching through the result list an attacker can find the root password and own that system.
