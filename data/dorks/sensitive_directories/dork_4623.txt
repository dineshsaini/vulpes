 *Explanation: *
 
 Bash allows us to create our own shortcuts through the use of aliases and
 shell functions. Aliases can be declared in bash files. These aliases will
 last as long as our shell session is present.
 
 To create an alias insert the following command in to .bashrc file
 
 *alias alias_name="command_to_run"*
 
 Apache server comes with a default offline .bashrc file which can be
 exploited further if the alias commands are found.
 
 *Remediation:*
 
 1. Disable Directory listing in the server.
 2. Remove .bashrc files in the production server or remove the Read / Write
 permission of the file through internet.
