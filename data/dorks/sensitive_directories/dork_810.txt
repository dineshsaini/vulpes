Description:      "Web File Browser" "Use regular expression"


This will ask google to search for a php script used to manage files on a server. The script "Web File Browser" enables users to change files on the server. The script comes un-protected, which means that anyone who knows the exact path of the php file can have admin access to files on that server.
