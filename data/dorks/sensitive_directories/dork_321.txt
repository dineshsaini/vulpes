Description:      Index of phpMyAdmin


phpMyAdmin is a tool written in PHP intended to handle the administration of MySQL over the Web. Currently it can create and drop databases, create/drop/alter tables, delete/edit/add fields, execute any SQL statement, manage keys on fields (http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpmyadmin/).An attacker can use this search to find phpMyAdmin enabled MySQL servers by using the "index of /" method. Consider this an alternative way an attacker could find them besides the older Googledorks for phpMyAdmin.
