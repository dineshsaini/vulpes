Description:      intitle:"PHPBTTracker Statistics" | intitle:"PHPBT Tracker Statistics"


This query shows pages which summarise activity on PHPBT-powered BitTorrent trackers - all the torrents currently being "tracked".This is useful to people who want to find active BitTorrent trackers for downloading - including ones which aren't 'public'. It is also useful for people wanting to gain some clues into a tracker's/site's setup. People targetting BitTorrent trackers because of the questionable legality of their general usage may also find this query useful!Often, the URL involved can be changed to access the configuration / installation / deletion script.. which are obviously *not* intended for public access, even if the statistics page is.
