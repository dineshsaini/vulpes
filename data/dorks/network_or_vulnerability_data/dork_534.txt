"WhatsUp Gold's new SNMP Viewer tool enables Area-Wide to easily track variables associated with any port on a network device. With a few simple clicks, a network engineer can select device ports, navigate trees, and graph variables in real time. For instance, Area-Wide can track bandwidth or CPU utilization on a router to aid in capacity and resource management."
