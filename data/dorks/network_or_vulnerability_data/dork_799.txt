Description:      intitle:"BNBT Tracker Info"


This query shows pages which summarise activity on BNBT-powered BitTorrent trackers - including all the torrents currently being "tracked", the BNBT software version, links to user-lists and 'admin' pages, etc.This is useful to people who want to find active BitTorrent trackers for downloading - including ones which aren't 'public'. It is also useful for people wanting to gain some clues into a tracker's/site's setup. Some versions of BNBT are also vulnerable to a DOS attack. People targetting BitTorrent trackers because of the questionable legality of their general usage may also find this query useful!
