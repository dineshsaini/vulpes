It has been reported that on (rare) occosions this page ->http://[indexu server]/recovery_tools/create_admin_user.phpindicates admin login is possible by the appearance of three text lines:Create Administrator LoginDelete old administrator user ....okCreate new administrator user ....okAn attacker can then change the URL tohttp://[target]/admin/index.php and enter:user=adminpass=adminBut that's if you find them..
