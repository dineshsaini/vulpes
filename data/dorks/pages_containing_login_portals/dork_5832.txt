Description:      inurl:/forgotpassword intext:"enter username and email"


# Google Dork: inurl:/forgotpassword intext:"enter username and email"
 
 # The search results found from this dork, are potentially vulnerable sites
 to account takeover. If attacker inserts victim's username along with
 attacker's email address, than attacker might receive password reset link
 or code for the target user on his(attacker) own mail. Or, if attacker
 attempts password reset for his own account, then intercept and modifies
 the http request body with victim credentials(i.e. username, email), than
 he might successfully reach victim's password reset page. Using these two
 methods, attacker might be able to takeover any user account.
