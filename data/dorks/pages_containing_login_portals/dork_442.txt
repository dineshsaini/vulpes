Jetbox is a content management systems (CMS) that uses MySQL or equivalent databases. There is a vulnerability report at SF wich I think is overrated, but I will mention here:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/10858/discussion/The file holding the password is called: "http://.../includes/general_settings.inc.php"It does come with default passwords and that is allways a security risk. The administration is available via /admin/Username: admin, Password: admin1 .
