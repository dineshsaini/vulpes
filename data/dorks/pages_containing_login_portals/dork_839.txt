With ePowerSwitch D4 Guard, up to four devices can be individually switched on and off, also with programmed switching states. The activated Guard function ensures exceptionally high equipment availability: continually monitors whether the connected IP-based devices are still active, it can automatically, without user input, reboot any crashed device.
