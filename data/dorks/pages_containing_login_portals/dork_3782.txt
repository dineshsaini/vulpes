Description:      "mailing list memberships reminder"


Hi, By default, while subscribing to a mailing list on a website, running Mailman (GNU) for mailing list management, the user has got options to manage his/her subscription options. There is an option of getting password reminder email for this list once in a month. And, by default, this option is set to Yes. Along with sending the password reminder mail in *plain text* to the users, it gets archived on the sites too. Thanks, Sagar Belure
