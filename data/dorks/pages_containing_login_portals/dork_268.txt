WRQ Reflection gives you a standard desktop that includes web- and Windows-based terminal emulation and X Windows products. Terminal emulation settings are saved to a configuration file, depending on the version called r1w, r2w, or r4w. If an attacker loads these files he can access the main login screen on mainframe systems for example.
