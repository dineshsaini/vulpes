GoogleDork:       pwd.db
Description:      pwd.db


There's nothing that defines a googleDork more than getting your PASSWORDS grabbed by Google for the world to see. Truly the epitome of a googleDork. The his in this search show "pwd.db" files which contain encrypted passwords which may look like this: "guest MMCHhvZ6ODgFo" A password cracker can eat cheesy hashes faster than Elvis eatin' jelly doughnuts. Bravo googleDorks! Good show!
