BARF log filesMan page:Barf outputs (on standard output) a collection of debugging information (contents of files, selections from logs, etc.) related to the IPSEC encryption/authentication system. It is primarily a convenience for remote debugging, a single command which packages up (and labels) all information that might be relevant to diagnosing a problem in IPSEC.
