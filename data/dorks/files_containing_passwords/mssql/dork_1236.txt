Description:      filetype:bak createobject sa


This query searches for files that have been renamed to a .bak extension (obviously), but includes a search for the characters "sa" (default SQL server admin id) and "createobject" which is requisite VBScript for opening some sort of odbc/ado connection. Since the sql id and password are plain text, it's easy to connect to the SQL server once you have this information... especially those that use "server=127.0.0.1" so you know IIS & SQL Server are running on the same box.
