GoogleDork:       mysql history files
Description:      mysql history files


The .mysql_history file contains commands that were performed against a mysql database. A "history" of said commands. First, you shouldn't show this file to anyone, especially not a MAJOR SEARCH ENGINE! Secondly, I sure hope you wouldn't type anything sensitive while interacting with your databases, like oh say USERNAMES AND PASSWORDS...
