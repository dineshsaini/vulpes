GoogleDork:       htpasswd / htpasswd.bak
Description:      htpasswd / htpasswd.bak


There's nothing that defines a googleDork more than getting your PASSWORDS grabbed by Google for the world to see. Truly the epitome of a googleDork. And what if the passwords are hashed? A password cracker can eat cheesy password hashes faster than Elvis eatin' jelly doughnuts. Bravo googleDorks! Good show!
