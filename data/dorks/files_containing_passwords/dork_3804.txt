Description:      ext:xml ("mode_passive"|"mode_default")


OffSec: So the dork is: ext:xml ("mode_passive"|"mode_default") This dork finds Filezilla XML files.� To be more specific; ��� recentservers.xml ��� sitemanager.xml ��� filezilla.xml These files contain clear text usernames and passwords.� They also contain the hostname or IP to connect to as well as the port.� Most of these results will be for FTP however, you can also get port 22 to SSH in.� This dork of course can be modified to target a specific website by appending site:whateversite.com.� You can also look for a specific username like root by appending "root" to the dork.�� Regards, necrodamus http://www.twitter.com/necrodamus2600 http://www.photobucket.com/profile/necrodamus2600
