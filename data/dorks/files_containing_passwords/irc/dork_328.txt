GoogleDork:       NickServ registration passwords
Description:      NickServ registration passwords


NickServ allows you to "register" a nickname (on some IRC networks) and prevent others from using it. Some channels also require you to use a registered nickname to join.This search contains the the nickserv response message to a nick registration. Lots of example sites, but some that aren't... you can see which ones are fake or not in the search (some are like, your_password, while other are more realistic ones).
