Description:      intitle:"index.of" "places.sqlite" "key3.db" -mozilla.org


This dork finds Mozilla Firefox stored passwords, bookmarks, history and 
 many other information. It leads you to the ".default" 
 folder where Firefox stores all the user data.
 
 Also try:
 intitle:"index.of"  "permissions.sqlite" "cookies.sqlite" -mozilla.org
 
 
 The passwords are stored in two different files, both of which are required:
 
     key3.dbkey4.db (or key3.db, or key4.db) - This file stores the key 
 database for the user's passwords. To transfer saved passwords, you must 
 copy this file along with the logins.json which have the saved passwords.

 Bookmarks, Downloads and Browsing History  ->   places.sqlite
 
 
 Site-specific preferences  ->   permissions.sqlite
 
 
 Search engines  ->   search.json.mozlz4
 
 
 Personal dictionary  ->   persdict.dat
