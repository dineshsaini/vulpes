This search is a cleanup of a previous entry by J0hnny. It uses "parent directory" to avoid results other than directory listings.WS_FTP.ini is a configuration file for a popular win32 FTP client that stores usernames and weakly encoded passwords. There is another way to find this file, that was added by Xewan:filetype:ini ws_ftp pwdIn our experience it's good to try both methods, as the results will differ quite a bit.
