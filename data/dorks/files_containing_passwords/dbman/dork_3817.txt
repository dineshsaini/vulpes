Description:      inurl:"/dbman/default.pass"


A path to a DES encrypted password for DBMan (
 
 http://www.gossamer-threads.com/products/archive.html) ranging from Guest
 
 to Admin account, this is often found coupled with cgi-telnet.pl (
 
 http://www.rohitab.com/cgi-telnet) which provides an admin login, by
 
 default and the password provided by DBMan's path /dbman/default.pass
 
 
 
 
 
 I have already posted this to packetstorm on June 7th 2004, called
 
 cgitelnetdbman (
 
 http://packetstormsecurity.org/files/29530/cgitelnetdbman.pdf.html)
 
 
 
 The 'Dork' is *inurl:"/dbman/default.pass" *
