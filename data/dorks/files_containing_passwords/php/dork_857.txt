Description:      filetype:inc mysql_connect OR mysql_pconnect


INC files have PHP code within them that contain unencrypted usernames, passwords, and addresses for the corresponding databases. Very dangerous stuff. The mysql_connect file is especially dangerous because it handles the actual connection and authentication with the database.
