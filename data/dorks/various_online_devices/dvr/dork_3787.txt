Beyond TV gives you the capability to turn your PC into a high quality, digital video recorder (DVR). Most people use it for cable TV so that they don't have to spend rent money on a low end quality hardware DVR from their cable company. It's default config has no password or username enabled. Very bad for people who connect their PCs directly to their modems. I have Beyond TV and I was curious on how secure it is.
