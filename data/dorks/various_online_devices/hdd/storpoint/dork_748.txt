Description:      axis storpoint "file view" inurl:/volumes/


The Axis Storpoint device turns a SCSI or ATA box with lots of cdrom players (or writers) into a cd tower which can be browsed through any browser. The default admin password combo = root/pass. CD access can be password restricted like in Apache. Axis uses it's own server software. Many vulnerabilities can be found in the security databases like SF.
