This should reveal Belkin routers. Interestingly, Belkin routers by default have remote administration on, and act as a webserver for administration. Also by default, their password is blank (and the login page helpfuly informs the attacker of this).Once he's in, there's all kinds of annoying stuff he could get into, and it could also be used more blackhackishly to disable security.
