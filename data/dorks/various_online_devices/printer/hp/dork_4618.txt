The following Google search gives output of HP printers whose authentication
 is not set. Hence an attacker can simply visit the links from the dork
 output to set Administrator Password .
 
 
 "Use these fields to set or change the Administrator Password. When set, the
 Administrator Password is required before you can access and change
 configuration parameters. To disable the Administrator Password, leave the
 entries blank."
 
 
 Once the password is set, the attacker gets admin access to the HP printer.
 This can be used to cause disruption.
