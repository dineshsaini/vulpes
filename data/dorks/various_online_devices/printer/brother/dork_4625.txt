The following dork gives the list of Brother Printers whose panels do not have an administrator password.
 
 Steps to take control of the Brother printer ::
 
 
 1. Use the dork to get the list of Brother printers whose password is not configured. The user will get output like hxxp://{URL}/address/speeddial.html?start=1&pageid=10
 2. Extract the URL/IP and construct a URL like hxxp://{URL}/admin/password.html
 3. This URL will lead the attacker to the page where administrator password can be set.
