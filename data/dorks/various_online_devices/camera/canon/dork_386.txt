Description:      Canon Webview netcams


Canon has a series of netcams that all use the "WebView LiveScope" software. They are frequently used by japanese sites. Unfortunately most are crawled by their IP address so determining their location becomes more difficult. Some model names are:* VB-C10* VB-101* VB-C50iThis search looks for the java applet called "LiveApplet" that is used by Canon's network camera feeds. There is also a standalone (free) program, that is easier to control and lets you save bookmarks. It's available for PC and MACs. The win32 download is here: http://www.x-zone.canon.co.jp/cgi-bin/nph-wvh35-cs.cgi
