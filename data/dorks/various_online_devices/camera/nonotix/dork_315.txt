Description:      Mobotix netcams


Mobotix netcams use the thttpd-2.x. server (http://www.acme.com/software/thttpd/). The latest version today is 2.25b, but most cams run older versions. They produce a rather nice image quality.Moderator note: this search was found by L0om and cleaned up by Wolveso.
