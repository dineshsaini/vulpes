These AXIS cams seem to run their own http server (Boa/0.94.13). The setup button can be hidden. The devices ship with a default password pair (quoting from the FAQ): "By default, the username will be root and the password will be pass. If these are not the current values, performing a factory default on the unit will reset the password to pass."Some models found in this search:- AXIS 205 version 4.0x- AXIS 210 Network Camera version: 4.0x- AXIS 241S Video Server version: 4.0x- AXIS 241Q Video Server version 4.0x
