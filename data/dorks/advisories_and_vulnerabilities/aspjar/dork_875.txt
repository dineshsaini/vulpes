Description:      "delete entries" inurl:admin/delete.asp


As described in OSVDB article #13715:"AspJar contains a flaw that may allow a malicious user to delete arbitrary messages. The issue is triggered when the authentication method is bypassed and /admin/delete.asp is accessed directly. It is possible that the flaw may allow a malicious user to delete messages resulting in a loss of integrity."The company supporting this software is no longer in business and the software is no longer being updated. Therefore, versions should not matter in this dork.
