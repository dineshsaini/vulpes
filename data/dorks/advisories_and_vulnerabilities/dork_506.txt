The remote user can reportedly view the first string of any file on the system where script installed. This is a very old bug, but some sites never upgraded their MRTG installations.http://www.securitytracker.com/alerts/2002/Feb/1003426.htmlAn attacker will find it difficult to exploit this in any usefull way, but it does expose one line of text from a file, for example (using the file /etc/passwd) shows this:ERROR: CFG Error Unknown Option "root:x:0:1:super-user:/" on line 2 or above.
