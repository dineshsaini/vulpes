Description:      "error_log" inurl:/wp-content


Find various www readable Wordpress directories containing error logs with 
 
 server side debugging info, such as home path directory names, which are 
 
 often the same user names for logging into the server over FTP and SSH.
 
 
 
 This often exposes the path of the plug-ins installed in wordpress as well, 
 
 giving someone more information and avenues of attack since many Wordpress 
 
 plug-ins can lead to compromises of the sites security. - DigiP
