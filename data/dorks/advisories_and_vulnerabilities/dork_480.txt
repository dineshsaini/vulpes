DasBlog is reportedly susceptible to an HTML injection vulnerability in its request log. This vulnerability is due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input data before using it in the generation of dynamic web pages. Versions 1.3 - 1.6 are reported to be vulnerable.More:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/11086/discussion/
