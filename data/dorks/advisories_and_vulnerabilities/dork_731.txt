It is reported that the 'viewing.php' script does not properly validate user-supplied input in the 'path' variable. A remote user can submit a specially crafted URL to view a list of files within an arbitrary directory. See http://securitytracker.com/alerts/2004/Nov/1012312.html for more information.
