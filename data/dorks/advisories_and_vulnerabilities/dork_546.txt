Description:      "Powered by A-CART"


A-CART is an ASP shopping cart application written in VBScript. It is comprised of a number of ASP scripts and an Access database. A security vulnerability in the product allows remote attackers to download the product's database, thus gain access to sensitive information about users of the product (name, surname, address, e-mail, credit card number, and user's login-password). http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5597 (search SF for more)
