GoogleDork:       Apache online documentation
Description:      Apache online documentation


When you install the Apache web server, you get a nice set of online documentation. When you learn how to use Apache, your supposed to delete these online Apache manuals. These sites didn't. If they're in such a hurry with Apache installs, I wonder what else they rushed through?
