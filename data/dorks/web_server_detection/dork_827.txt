Description:      XAMPP "inurl:xampp/index"


XAMPP is an easy to install Apache distribution containing MySQL, PHP and Perl. XAMPP is really very easy to install and to use - just download, extract and start. At the moment there are three XAMPP distributions.-allows you to write emails (mercury Mail)-some phpmyadmin are unprotected-security details of the server-maybe some more things ;-)
