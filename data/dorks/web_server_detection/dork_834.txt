Rather than submitting various searches for all kinds of NetWare related pages, Novell NetWare's Home Page is a good place to start for profiling the services available on a NetWare powered system. The results will often include all (or at least some) of the following links to different services on a system - including Server Certificates, iFolder, iManager, NetStorage, Enterprise Web Server Management and the Web Search Manager!
