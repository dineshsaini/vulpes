These printers are not-only web-enabled, but their management interface somehow got crawled by google! These puppies should not be public! You can really muck with these printers. In some cases, going to the "password.shtml" page, you can even lock out the admins if a username and password has not already been set! Thanks to mephisteau@yahoo.co.uk for the idea =)
